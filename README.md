# SpaceStation
> Immersive VR Space experience

## Run
To run the Project simply clone the Repository and execute the build inside the release folder, or open it in Unity.


## Description
During our AR/VR Lab @ Hochschule Karlsruhe we build a simple VR experience. We used Unity and SteamVR to create a SpaceStation that moves around the earth. Using different SteamVR Scripts we implemented behaviors like teleportation, interacting with objects without gravity and pushing buttons.


## Interactions
You can control the speed of the SpaceShip using buttons that are located on the control panel on the front. The middle button teleports the player on top of the ship, where you can enjoy the view. To get back simply press the button located on top of the ship. You can move around using the teleport feature when pressing the trigger of the Vive controllers. There Also Buttons that spawn spheres that can be thrown around.
